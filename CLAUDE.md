# The ePIC experiment Hardware Database

## Inspiration
This project is a Django-based implementation of the Component Database,
based on the ideas of the legacy application written in Java, as described
in the legacy user guide in the file assets/docs/The_Legacy_Component_Database_User_Guide.pdf

## seed_hdb

The seed_hdb command should contain the following entities:

* Groups:
  * BEMC
  * BTOF
  * PFRICH

* Users:
  * admin - superuser, staff
  * maxim - superuser, staff
  * gnigmat - user, belongs to groups: BTOF
  * crafts - user, belongs to groups: BEMC

* Technical systems:
  * BEMC-CRYSTAL, group set to "BEMC"
  * BEMC-PM, group set to "BEMC"
  * BTOF-Sensor, group set to "BTOF"
  * BTOF-Readout, group set to "BTOF"

* Locations:
  * CUA, Storage Room
  * UIC, Test Lab

* Components:
 * PbWO4 Crystal (to be used in the BEMC-CRYSTAL technical system)
 * Hamamatsu S14160-3010PS (to be used in the BEMC-PM)
 * AC-LGAD Sensor (to be used in BTOF-Sensor technical system)
 * FCFDv2 Readout (to be used in the BTOF-Readout technical system)

 Create between 2 and 5 component instances for each component.


## Deployment (epic-hwdb01, RHEL 9)

Use uv for dependency management. On the deployment RHEL machine, set
`UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/direct/eic+u/eicmax/.virtualenvs/hdb` when syncing
so the existing systemd service continues using the same virtualenv. If pip
is needed for unrelated diagnostics, use `pip3` to avoid the older system pip.

Production/target host: `epic-hwdb01`, RHEL 9, user `eicmax`. Public URL:
`https://epic-hwdb.sdcc.bnl.gov` (via SDCC's reverse proxy; see the Apache
section below for the actual topology). Code is delivered via git only:
changes are made and committed elsewhere, pushed to GitHub
(`BNLNPPS/epic-hdb`), then pulled on the host. Do not edit files directly in
the web root or the live tree. Never put secrets (passwords, SECRET_KEY) in
this file or in git.

Status legend: **[running]** already installed and working, **[TODO]** planned,
not done yet. Items marked "verify on host" have not been recorded here; inspect
the host and fill in the real values.

### PostgreSQL [running]
* Already installed and running as a system service. Verify on host: version,
  service name, port, data directory, and the `pg_hba.conf` auth method.
* The app should use a dedicated database and role. Verify on host: their names.
  Passwords come from the environment or a root-owned file, never from git.
* [running] `hdb_project/settings.py` now switches `DATABASES` on the
  `DJANGO_DB_TYPE` environment variable (`sqlite` for local dev, `postgres`
  here). Postgres mode reads `DJANGO_DB_NAME`/`USER`/`PASSWORD`/`HOST`/`PORT`
  from the environment — set via the `/etc/hdb/env` file, never hardcoded
  or committed. Data must be migrated/reseeded (`seed_hdb`), not copied as
  a file.
* **Gotcha (bit us once):** `DJANGO_DB_TYPE` defaults silently to `sqlite`
  when unset — no error, no warning, just the wrong database. Any bare shell
  on the host that hasn't sourced `/etc/hdb/env` for *that* session will
  quietly create/use a throwaway `db.sqlite3` in the repo instead of talking
  to Postgres. This once caused a real, confusing migration-graph conflict
  (two different `0004` migrations — one generated against sqlite by
  mistake, the other the real one from git) that took real effort to
  untangle. `/etc/hdb/env` is intentionally root-only-readable (it holds the
  DB password), so a plain `eicmax` shell can't just `source` it — either
  wrap the command in `sudo bash -c '...'` (see the smoke-check example
  below), or set up a dedicated group for it. **[TODO]**: add
  `export DJANGO_DB_TYPE=postgres` to `~/.virtualenvs/hdb/bin/activate` so a
  bare shell fails loudly (`ImproperlyConfigured`, missing credentials)
  instead of silently succeeding against sqlite.
* **Policy: the real `/etc/hdb/env` is never committed to this repo,**
  full stop — it holds `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DJANGO_DB_PASSWORD`, and
  will likely accumulate more secrets over time, and it's too easy to
  `git add` a working copy by accident while debugging on the host.
  `.gitignore` has explicit patterns to catch a stray copy if one ever
  ends up inside the repo tree. `deploy/env.example` documents the keys
  it must contain, with placeholder values only — keep that file in
  sync by hand whenever a new `DJANGO_*` variable is added to
  `settings.py`; nothing enforces that automatically.

### Apache httpd [running]
* Config lives in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` (the `<VirtualHost *:80>`
  block, `ServerName epic-hwdb.sdcc.bnl.gov`) and
  `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` (the `<VirtualHost _default_:443>` block).
  A versioned copy of the `:80` fragment is under `deploy/httpd/hdb.conf`
  in this repo — **note: that file's `ServerName` is stale**
  (still says `epic-hwdb01...` instead of the corrected
  `epic-hwdb.sdcc.bnl.gov`), and it doesn't reflect the `:443` block at all
  yet; needs reconciling.
* **Actual traffic path (cost real debugging time to find):** SDCC's
  institutional reverse proxy terminates TLS for
  `https://epic-hwdb.sdcc.bnl.gov` at its own edge (port 443, external) and
  forwards plain HTTP internally — but to *this* Apache's port **443**, not
  80. The `:80` vhost exists and works for direct/internal HTTP access, but
  is not what the public URL actually reaches. If the public site ever
  appears to serve stale/wrong content despite the `:80` vhost looking
  correctly configured (`httpd -S`, `apachectl configtest` all clean),
  check the `:443` vhost's directives first.
* The `:443` vhost reuses the stock self-signed cert
  (`/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt` / `/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key`)
  — no dedicated host cert was needed, since the reverse proxy completes the
  TLS handshake without validating the backend's cert chain/hostname.
* Both vhosts proxy to gunicorn the same way: `/static/` and `/media/` are
  served directly via `Alias` (excluded from the proxy with `ProxyPass ... !`),
  everything else goes to `http://127.0.0.1:8002/`.
* Institutional SSO (`mod_auth_openidc`, CILogon) sits in front of this too —
  an unauthenticated request gets redirected to `cilogon.org` before it ever
  reaches this app's content. Its config file hasn't been located yet (it's
  not caught by a `ServerName|VirtualHost` grep of `conf.d/` — look for
  `OIDCProviderMetadataURL`/`OIDCRedirectURI`/`<Location>` instead).
* SELinux: **[TODO, not yet confirmed applied]**. Check `getenforce`.
  Proxying to gunicorn needs the `httpd_can_network_connect` boolean, and
  static/media directories need the `httpd_sys_content_t` (read) or
  `httpd_sys_rw_content_t` (media, writable) context. Do not disable
  SELinux.
* Media: `MEDIA_ROOT` in settings is `/var/data/hdb/media`; this directory
  must exist, be writable by the app user, and be readable by httpd.
* **Gotcha (bit us once, 2026-09-28):** the DRF browsable API at `/api/`
  builds its hyperlinks from `request.get_host()`, and because
  `ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8002/` doesn't preserve the original
  Host header, those links were showing gunicorn's internal
  `http://127.0.0.1:8002/...` instead of the public hostname. Tried to
  fix it by setting `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True` in `settings.py` and
  relying on Apache's `ProxyAddHeaders On` default to supply
  `X-Forwarded-Host` automatically. Result: **every single request on
  the live site started 400ing** (`DisallowedHost`) the moment it was
  deployed. The obvious theory — that Apache's automatic header was
  colliding with a manually-added `RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Host`
  directive, producing a merged `"host, host"` value that fails the
  `ALLOWED_HOSTS` check — turned out to be wrong for this outage: no
  such `RequestHeader` line was ever actually present in the live
  `ssl.conf` (confirmed by grepping the file directly). The real
  mechanism was never conclusively identified; the SDCC lab's own
  outer reverse proxy sits in front of this Apache and may itself be
  injecting Host-related headers before this box ever sees the
  request, but that's a hypothesis, not a confirmed cause. **Fixed by
  reverting through git** — commented out `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True`
  in `settings.py`, committed on the dev machine, pulled + restarted
  gunicorn on RHEL (deliberately *not* hand-patched live on RHEL, to
  avoid the kind of untracked drift the `DJANGO_DB_TYPE` incident left
  behind). **Current state, accepted as-is:** `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` is
  off; `/api/` hyperlinks show the internal `127.0.0.1:8002` address
  again. This is cosmetic, not a security exposure (that address isn't
  reachable from outside the host) — **do not re-attempt this fix
  without first getting visibility into what headers the SDCC outer
  proxy actually sends** (e.g. by logging request headers gunicorn
  receives for one real request), rather than reasoning about the
  proxy chain from the RHEL Apache config alone.
* **Loose end from the above, not yet resolved:** `ProxyPreserveHost`
  was found commented out in the live `:443` block in `ssl.conf` during
  this troubleshooting (it predates this session and its original
  purpose is unknown). It was toggled off as part of the
  investigation and never consciously restored either way. `ssl.conf`
  is hand-maintained on RHEL and not git-tracked, so this state isn't
  captured anywhere else — worth deciding deliberately (on or off)
  next time this file is touched, rather than leaving it as an
  accident of troubleshooting.
* `deploy/systemd/hdb-gunicorn.service` in this repo mirrors the installed
  `/etc/systemd/system/hdb-gunicorn.service` unit.

### Python application [running]
* Dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` (Python 3.12+, Django 6.0.8,
  `djangorestframework`, `qrcode[pil]`, `psycopg[binary]` for PostgreSQL, plus
  their transitive dependencies). RHEL 9's default `python3` is 3.9, which is
  too old; install `python3.12` from AppStream (`sudo dnf install python3.12`)
  or use `uv`.
* `pyproject.toml` preserves all pins from the former shared dev
  `requirements.txt`, including the `hdb_client` CLI/MCP server packages
  (`mcp`, `uvicorn`, `starlette`, `httpx`, `typer`, etc.). `uv.lock` locks the
  resolved dependencies; `.python-version` selects Python 3.12 by default.
  Install from the checkout with
  `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/direct/eic+u/eicmax/.virtualenvs/hdb uv sync --locked --no-editable`
  on production, or `uv sync --locked --extra client` for development with
  the MCP CLI extra. Sync removes undeclared packages: this must be a dedicated
  application environment. Templates/static assets and the
  `hdb_client` package are included; existing script commands still work.
* Django REST framework is required in production: it's wrapped in a
  `try/except ImportError` in `settings.py`, so a missing install won't crash
  the app, it will just silently disable the whole `/api/` surface that
  `hdb_client` depends on. It's in `pyproject.toml`, so a normal
  `uv sync --locked` covers it — just don't skip that step.
* Plan:
  1. [done] Cloned as `eicmax` outside the web root, at `~/projects/epic-hdb`
     (real absolute path `/direct/eic+u/eicmax/projects/epic-hdb` — an NFS
     automount; use the absolute path in scripts/services, `~` is fine
     interactively), with a `virtualenvwrapper`-style venv at
     `~/.virtualenvs/hdb` (`/direct/eic+u/eicmax/.virtualenvs/hdb`),
     Python 3.12.
    2. [done] Dependencies installed; for future updates, install uv and use
      `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/direct/eic+u/eicmax/.virtualenvs/hdb uv sync --locked --no-editable`.
      The uv workflow has been tested locally, not yet applied on the host.
  3. Production settings: `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` now includes
     `https://epic-hwdb.sdcc.bnl.gov` **[done]**. `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`,
     `ALLOWED_HOSTS` **[done, 2026-09-28]** — all three now read from
     `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` / `DJANGO_DEBUG` / `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in
     `/etc/hdb/env` (same mechanism as `DJANGO_DB_TYPE`), with one
     deliberate difference: these three default to the *safe* choice
     when unset (`DEBUG` off, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to `localhost,127.0.0.1`
     only) rather than defaulting open, precisely so a missing env var
     here fails closed instead of repeating the `DJANGO_DB_TYPE`
     silent-sqlite-fallback mistake in the other direction.
  4. [done] `STATIC_ROOT` set (`/var/data/hdb/static`), `collectstatic` run.
  5. [done] `python manage.py migrate`, admin user created (not the dev
     `seed_hdb` users/passwords). See the `DJANGO_DB_TYPE` gotcha above —
     always confirm `showmigrations hdb` shows a single clean chain (no
     unexpected extra leaf) before trusting a `migrate` run on this host.
  6. [done] gunicorn runs under `hdb-gunicorn.service` (systemd), bound to
     `127.0.0.1:8002`, `enable`d so it survives a reboot.
  7. Smoke-check the app and database directly (no server, no HTTP, no auth)
     using the local CLI client already in the repo. `/etc/hdb/env` is
     root-only-readable, so wrap this in `sudo`:
     ```
     sudo bash -c '
       set -a; source /etc/hdb/env; set +a
       cd /direct/eic+u/eicmax/projects/epic-hdb
       source /direct/eic+u/eicmax/.virtualenvs/hdb/bin/activate

       python client/hdb.py institutions
       python client/hdb.py systems
       python client/hdb.py search Crystal
       python client/hdb.py component "PbWO4 Crystal"

       # exercises DesignTemplate.source_path/source_sha256/source_git_commit
       # and the on_delete=PROTECT location relationships (migrations 0004-0007):
       python client/hdb.py verify-template data/btof_split/btof_stave.yaml
       python client/hdb.py verify-template data/btof_split/btof_half_stave.yaml
       python client/hdb.py verify-template data/btof_split/btof_stavelet.yaml
       python client/hdb.py verify-template data/bemc_tower_template.yaml
       python client/hdb.py bom-template "BTOF Stave"
       python client/hdb.py bom-template "BEMC tower"
     '
     ```
     This queries the same Postgres DB the running app uses, in-process —
     confirms `migrate`/`seed_hdb` actually landed real data. Don't confuse
     this with `client/mcp_server.py` + `client/smoke_test.py`: that pair
     stands up its own HTTP+MCP server process to test the network-facing
     MCP endpoint (for an agent/connector talking to HDB remotely) — a
     separate concern, not part of the running deployment unless/until
     that's wired up on its own.
     Note: `data/btof_stave_templates.yaml` is deprecated (superseded by
     `data/btof_split/*.yaml`) — don't load/verify against it.
* After each `git pull` on the host: activate the venv, run
  `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/direct/eic+u/eicmax/.virtualenvs/hdb uv sync --locked --no-editable`
  again (in case dependencies changed), then `migrate`
  and `collectstatic`, then restart the gunicorn service. Back up the database
  (`pg_dump`) before any migration. **Confirm `DJANGO_DB_TYPE=postgres` and
  the rest of `/etc/hdb/env` are actually sourced in that shell first** — see
  the gotcha above; this is the single most likely way to silently do the
  wrong thing on this host.

### Working on the host with Claude
* Prefer read-only diagnostics first (versions, `getenforce`, service status,
  config files). Ask before any change that needs `sudo`, touches the
  database, or restarts a service.
* Test changes in a clone, not in `/var/www/html`.
* Dev-side filesystem quirk: this repo is accessed both natively on Windows
  and through a Linux mount of the same NTFS volume, which can spuriously
  flip a file's executable bit with no content change. `core.fileMode false`
  is set locally to stop git from treating that as a diff — leave it set.
