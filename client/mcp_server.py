"""
mcp_server.py — MCP server for the Hardware Database (HDB), user-facing.

Authentication model
---------------------
HTTP Basic Auth, validated against Django's own auth.User table via
django.contrib.auth.authenticate(). There is no separate credential
store: whatever accounts already exist in the HDB database (created via
/admin/, `createsuperuser`, or your own signup flow) are exactly the
accounts that can use this MCP server. Passwords are never handled by
this file beyond passing them straight into Django's authenticate() —
they are checked against Django's existing salted-hash storage and are
never logged, stored, or echoed back.

Every authenticated request is bound to a Django User for its duration,
via a contextvar (see AuthContext below). Every tool builds a
HDBClient(user=...) scoped to that user -- kept even though every tool
here is now read-only, so who asked is still known for logging/auditing,
and so a future read-scoping change to hdb_client/access.py's
visible_to() would apply here automatically without touching this file.

No tool in this file performs a create/update/delete of any kind. This
is a deliberate policy, not a gap: a dialogue-driven agent should not be
able to mutate HDB. See the comment above the ASGI app section for the
full rationale.

Transport
---------
This server only supports Streamable HTTP (not stdio). Basic Auth only
makes sense when there's a request per call to attach credentials to;
stdio is a single trusted local process with no per-call identity, so
it is intentionally not wired up here. If you need a local/dev mode,
use the existing CLI (`client/hdb.py`) directly instead, via
HDBClient(user=None).

NOTE ON LIBRARY VERSIONS
-------------------------
This uses `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` from the official Python MCP SDK,
and wraps its ASGI app with a Starlette middleware for Basic Auth. The
exact method name FastMCP exposes for the Streamable HTTP ASGI app
(`streamable_http_app()` below) has changed across SDK versions — check
`python -c "from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP; print(dir(FastMCP))"`
against your installed version and adjust the one call site marked below
if it differs.

def django_tool(fn):
    """
    Wrap a synchronous, Django-ORM-calling tool function so its body
    always runs on a real worker thread via asgiref.sync_to_async,
    regardless of how a given `mcp` SDK version schedules plain `def`
    tool functions.

    Why this exists: Django's ORM refuses a synchronous DB call made
    directly on the event-loop thread and raises exactly
    "You cannot call this from an async context — use a thread or
    sync_to_async." Some `mcp` SDK versions call `def` tools directly on
    the loop instead of offloading them to a thread, which trips that
    check the moment the tool touches the database. Wrapping explicitly
    here removes the dependency on the SDK's (undocumented, version-
    dependent) scheduling behavior entirely.

    thread_sensitive=False is deliberate: each call gets its own
    thread-pool worker rather than being serialized onto a single
    "main thread" — Django's ORM manages its own per-thread connections
    safely, so there's no need to pin all calls to one thread.

    Note on introspection: FastMCP builds each tool's argument schema
    from the function's signature. functools.wraps sets `__wrapped__`
    on the returned async wrapper, and inspect.signature() follows
    `__wrapped__` by default — so FastMCP still sees the original
    parameter names, types, and defaults correctly, even though the
    object it actually registers and awaits is this wrapper.

# `streamable_http_app()` is the FastMCP method name as of the current

# version — this is the one line most likely to need adjusting after
# `pip install`.
#
# IMPORTANT: attach the middleware to the app FastMCP already built —
# do NOT reconstruct a new Starlette app from `mcp_asgi_app.routes`.
# The returned app's *lifespan* starts the Streamable HTTP session
# manager (the background task group that tracks in-flight MCP
# sessions/streams); copying only `.routes` into a fresh Starlette()
# instance silently drops that lifespan, so the session manager never
# starts and the first real MCP request (`initialize`) 500s. Requests
# that get rejected at 401 (wrong/missing credentials) never reach that
# code path, so this bug is invisible to the auth-boundary checks and
# only shows up once a request actually authenticates.
