# The HDB Client

Three ways to talk to the Hardware Database from outside the web UI, all built
on the same permission-checked query/write layer:

| Layer | File(s) | Use it when... |
|---|---|---|
| **Python library** | `hdb_client/` | You're writing a script or another Django-adjacent tool and want direct ORM-speed access, in-process. |
| **Command-line tool** | `hdb.py` | You want to query or update HDB from a terminal or shell script. |
| **MCP server** | `mcp_server.py` | You want an AI assistant (Claude, etc.) or any other MCP client to query/update HDB over HTTP. |

All three are thin wrappers around `hdb_client`: they don't talk to the web
app's `/api/` endpoints over HTTP, they import Django directly and query the
ORM in-process. Run them from a machine that has this repo (and the same
`db.sqlite3` / database) available, not from a remote box.

Everything below was tested against this repo's own seed data (`python
manage.py seed_hdb`), so every example output you see here is real.

---

## Installation

From the project root (next to `manage.py`):

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra client
```

The root `pyproject.toml` pins the existing web app and client dependencies,
including `httpx` for `smoke_test.py`. The `client` extra enables `mcp[cli]`.
uv uses the Python 3.12 version selected by `.python-version` and installs
the project in editable mode, making `hdb_client` importable without adding
`client/` to `PYTHONPATH`. Run the commands below with
`uv run --locked --extra client python` instead of bare `python`, or activate
the managed environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` first.

The client code does not depend on `djangorestframework`, although it is
installed for the web app's `/api/` endpoints (`hdb/views.py`).

---

## 1. The `hdb_client` Python library

Inside `manage.py shell` or any Django management command, Django is already
configured — just `from hdb_client import HDBClient` and go. Nothing below
this paragraph is needed in that case.

From a *plain* Python script (not launched through `manage.py`), Django has
no idea where your settings module is until you tell it, via the
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable — `django.setup()` alone raises
`ImproperlyConfigured` without it. You also need two separate directories on
`sys.path`: the project root (for `hdb_project.settings`, and for `hdb_client`
to reach the Django app's `hdb.models`) and `client/` (for `hdb_client`
itself). Order matters: the project root must come *before* `client/`, or
Python resolves the bare name `hdb` to `client/hdb.py` (the CLI script)
instead of the real `hdb/` Django app package, and everything breaks with a
confusing `ImportError: cannot import name 'models' from 'hdb'`.

```python
import os, sys, django

ROOT = "/path/to/epic-hdb"          # repo root, next to manage.py
sys.path.insert(0, ROOT + "/client")  # so `import hdb_client` resolves
sys.path.insert(0, ROOT)              # must win over client/hdb.py -- insert last
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "hdb_project.settings")
django.setup()

from hdb_client import HDBClient
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Unscoped / trusted-shell use (no ownership checks on reads):
client = HDBClient()

# User-scoped use (required for anything that writes):
crafts = User.objects.get(username="crafts")
client = HDBClient(user=crafts)
```

This is exactly what `client/hdb_client/_bootstrap.py`'s `_bootstrap()`
helper does (it's what every domain module calls internally via `_m()` to
reach `hdb.models` lazily) — but note it is *not* currently called by
anything for this exact purpose, and its `project_root` argument only adds
one path (the root, for settings), not `client/` itself. So it works
unmodified for code living *inside* `hdb_client`, but an external script
importing `hdb_client` from outside the package still needs the two-path
setup above; `hdb.py` and `mcp_server.py` each additionally rely on Python's
own "script directory goes on sys.path[0] automatically" behavior to get
`client/` for free, since they *are* files inside `client/`, which is why
their bootstrap code only inserts the project root explicitly.

`HDBClient` aggregates five sub-clients, each covering one domain:

| Sub-client | Domain |
|---|---|
| `client.locations` | Institutions, physical location hierarchy |
| `client.systems` | Technical systems (BEMC-CRYSTAL, BTOF-Sensor, ...) |
| `client.catalog` | Component Catalog (the "what" — PbWO4 Crystal, etc.) |
| `client.inventory` | Component Inventory (the "which physical one, where") |
| `client.designs` | Design Library (assemblies + Bill of Materials) |

Plus two cross-domain helpers directly on `HDBClient`:

```python
client.search_all("Crystal")     # -> {"components": [...], "instances": [...], "designs": [...]}
client.where_is(instance_pk)     # -> flat dict: location, institution, owner, ...
```

### Locations & Institutions — `client.locations`

```python
client.locations.all_institutions()                     # queryset of Institution
client.locations.get_institution(abbreviation="CUA")
client.locations.institutions_by_country("USA")
client.locations.users_at_institution("BNL")             # UserProfile queryset

client.locations.all_locations()
client.locations.locations_at_institution("CUA")
client.locations.buildings(institution_abbr="BNL")
client.locations.rooms_in_building("Bldg,510A")

client.locations.location_tree("CUA")
# -> [{"id": ..., "name": "Storage Room", "type": "room", "children": []}]
```

### Technical Systems — `client.systems`

```python
client.systems.all()                          # queryset of TechnicalSystem
client.systems.get(name="BEMC-CRYSTAL")
client.systems.components("BEMC-CRYSTAL")     # Components assigned to this system
client.systems.instances("BEMC-CRYSTAL")      # Instances tagged with this system

client.systems.instance_counts()
# -> [{"id": ..., "name": "BEMC-CRYSTAL", "components": 1, "instances": 3}, ...]

client.systems.summary("BEMC-CRYSTAL")
# -> {"id": ..., "name": ..., "description": ..., "component_count": 1, "instance_count": 3}
```

### Component Catalog — `client.catalog`

```python
client.catalog.search("Crystal")                        # list[Component]
client.catalog.by_technical_system("BEMC-CRYSTAL")
client.catalog.by_project("ePIC")
client.catalog.get(name="PbWO4 Crystal")                 # or model_number=, pk=
client.catalog.instance_count("PbWO4 Crystal")           # -> int
client.catalog.all_components()                          # queryset, all visible components

# JSON-safe dict output (what the CLI/MCP tools actually return):
client.catalog.search_brief("Crystal")
# -> [{"id": ..., "name": "PbWO4 Crystal", "model_number": "PWO-BEMC-01",
#      "project": "ePIC", "technical_system": "BEMC-CRYSTAL",
#      "owner_group": "BEMC", "instance_count": 3}]

client.catalog.summary("PbWO4 Crystal")
# -> full dict: id, name, alternate_name, model_number, description, project,
#    technical_system, owner_user, owner_group, group_writeable,
#    created_on, modified_on, instance_count, sources[], properties[], log_entries[]
```

### Component Inventory — `client.inventory`

```python
client.inventory.get(pk)                                 # single ComponentInstance
client.inventory.instances_of("PbWO4 Crystal")
client.inventory.at_institution("CUA")
client.inventory.at_location("Storage Room", institution_abbr="CUA")
client.inventory.by_group("BEMC")
client.inventory.search("BEMC-CRYSTAL")
client.inventory.installed_in_design("BEMC tower")
client.inventory.institution_summary()
# -> [{"institution": "CUA", "count": 17}, {"institution": "UIC", "count": 9}, ...]
client.inventory.all_instances()                          # queryset, all visible instances

client.inventory.search_brief("BEMC-CRYSTAL")
# -> [{"id": ..., "tag": "BEMC-CRYSTAL-001", "serial_number": "PWO-0001",
#      "component": "PbWO4 Crystal", "location": "CUA / Storage Room",
#      "owner_group": "BEMC"}, ...]

client.inventory.detail(pk)
# -> full dict: id, tag, serial_number, description, component, technical_system,
#    location, owner_user, owner_group, group_writeable, created_on, modified_on,
#    properties[], log_entries[]
```

**Writing** — `client.inventory.create(...)` — requires a user-scoped client
(`HDBClient(user=...)`); anonymous callers are rejected outright. Ownership is
*never* taken from caller input: the new record's `owner_user` is always the
client's bound user, and `owner_group` must be a group that user actually
belongs to (or `None`, or staff/superuser bypasses the group check). This is
deliberate — see `hdb_client/access.py` — so there is no parameter to assign a
record to somebody else.

```python
result = client.inventory.create(
    component_name="PbWO4 Crystal",     # or component_pk=<uuid>
    tag="BEMC-CRYSTAL-099",
    serial_number="PWO-0099",
    description="New delivery, batch 12",
    location_name="Storage Room",       # must already exist
    owner_group_name="BEMC",            # must exist AND crafts must belong to it
)
# -> same shape as client.inventory.detail()
```

### Design Library — `client.designs`

```python
client.designs.get(name="BEMC tower")                     # or pk=
client.designs.by_project("ePIC")
client.designs.search("tower")
client.designs.elements_of("BEMC tower")                  # DesignElement queryset
client.designs.designs_using_component("PbWO4 Crystal")
client.designs.all_designs()                               # queryset, all visible designs
client.designs.flat_component_list("BEMC tower")            # BOM flattened, leaves only

client.designs.bom("BEMC tower")
# -> [{"element": "Crystal", "type": "COMPONENT", "qty": 1, "description": "",
#      "ref": "PbWO4 Crystal", "model_number": "PWO-BEMC-01",
#      "installed_ids": [...], "children": []},
#     {"element": "SiPM", "type": "COMPONENT", "qty": 4, "ref": "Hamamatsu S14160-3010PS",
#      ...}]
# A COMPONENT element's "installed_ids" lists every physical instance
# currently filling one of its `qty` slots (0 to qty of them). A DESIGN
# element instead has "ref" = the child design's name and a "children" BOM
# (designs can nest other designs).

client.designs.search_brief("tower")
# -> [{"id": ..., "name": "BEMC tower", "description": "...", "project": "ePIC",
#      "owner_group": "BEMC", "element_count": 2}]

client.designs.summary("BEMC tower")
# -> full dict: id, name, description, project, owner_user, owner_group,
#    group_writeable, created_on, modified_on, element_count, bom (full BOM tree)
```

### Design & Design Template architecture — see the top-level README

`Design`/`DesignElement` and `DesignTemplate`/`DesignTemplateElement` are
two structurally parallel models: `Design` supports real, unlimited-depth
nesting via `DesignElement.child_design`, and physical instance tracking;
`DesignTemplate` supports the equivalent nesting via
`DesignTemplateElement.child_template` -- a placeholder is either a leaf
(`component`, a real catalog `Component`) or a nested sub-assembly
(`child_template`, another `DesignTemplate`), exactly one of the two, ever.
A template can never nest itself, directly or through further levels, and
a `child_template` must share its parent's `project` and `owner_group` --
both enforced in `DesignTemplateElement.save()` (immediately if the named
`child_template` already exists; automatically, the moment it does, if
not -- see "loading order" below). Instantiating a
template that contains nested placeholders recursively instantiates a
child `Design` for each one too, so a multi-level template produces a
fully wired-up multi-level `Design` immediately, not empty slots to fill
in by hand -- but only once every placeholder beneath it has resolved
(`DesignTemplate.is_complete()`); instantiating an incomplete template is
rejected, both in `hdb_client` and the web UI. A template locks once any
`Design` is instantiated from it, and can only be *deleted* by a
superuser while unlocked AND not nested inside another template's
placeholder (`child_template` is `PROTECT`ed).

**The full conceptual explanation — the `Design` vs. `DesignTemplate`
comparison, the worked BTOF Stave → Half-Stave → Stavelet example, the
instantiation/locking lifecycle, and the self-nesting-cycle prevention --
now lives in the top-level [`README.md`, under "Domain 3 —
Designs"](../README.md#domain-3--designs). That's the single authoritative
place for it; this file only covers how to *drive* that model through
`hdb_client`, the CLI, and YAML, below.**

### Design Templates — loading from YAML

See [the architecture section in the top-level README](../README.md#domain-3--designs)
for what a `DesignTemplate` is and how multi-level hierarchies work; this
section covers the mechanics of loading one from a YAML file.

```python
client.designs.load_templates_from_yaml("data/btof_split/btof_stave.yaml")
# -> {"templates": [ per-template summary dicts, one per document:
#       {"template": "BTOF Stavelet", "template_created": True,
#        "elements": [{"element_name": "AC-LGAD Sensors", "component": "AC-LGAD Sensor",
#                      "component_created": False, "element_created": True}, ...],
#        "resolution": {"resolved": [...], "conflicts": [...]}}, ...],
#     "resolution": {"resolved": [...], "conflicts": [...]}}   # settled state after the whole file

client.designs.resolve_pending_references()
# -> re-check every outstanding pending reference in the database, not just
#    ones this file touched -- e.g. after someone else's separate upload.
#    Same {"resolved": [...], "conflicts": [...]} shape.

client.designs.template_bom("BTOF Stave")
# -> recursive parts explosion, same shape idea as designs.bom():
#    [{"element": "Half-Stave Assemblies", "type": "TEMPLATE", "ref": "BTOF Half-Stave",
#      "qty": 144, "description": "...",
#      "children": [ ... recurses into the BTOF Half-Stave template ... ]},
#     {"element": "Carbon Honeycomb Support", "type": "COMPONENT",
#      "ref": "BTOF Carbon Honeycomb Support", "model_number": "BTOF-SUPPORT-01",
#      "qty": 1, "description": "...", "children": []},
#     {"element": "Not Yet Uploaded", "type": "PENDING",
#      "ref": "Some Template Nobody's Loaded Yet", "qty": 1, "description": "...", "children": []}]

client.designs.all_templates()                 # queryset of DesignTemplate
client.designs.get_template(name="BTOF Stave")
client.designs.template_elements("BTOF Stave")  # DesignTemplateElement queryset
client.designs.create_template(name=..., project="ePIC", description=..., elements=[...])
```

**Idempotent** — safe to re-run: existing templates, elements, and
components are never modified or duplicated, only what's missing gets
created (`get_or_create` throughout, matching `seed_hdb.py`'s convention).
This is a curator/administrative operation, like `seed_hdb`, not a
per-request scoped write — `owner_group_name`/`owner_username` (or the
YAML's `owner_group`/`owner_user`) are recorded on the template if given, but
there's no requirement that the acting user belong to that group (unlike
`inventory.create()`).

**Loading order doesn't matter.** A `child_template` element doesn't have
to already exist — uploads are asynchronous, so a parent's file can be
loaded before the sub-template it names has been uploaded at all, in this
file, a separate file, or a separate `hdb load-template` run entirely.
When the named template doesn't exist yet, the placeholder is created as
*pending* (this still succeeds) and linked automatically -- with the same
project/owner_group/cycle validation an already-existing reference gets
immediately -- the moment a template with that name is eventually loaded.
Use `DesignTemplate.is_complete()` (or the template's detail page in the
web UI, which shows a banner naming exactly what's still missing) to see
whether anything is still outstanding; a `resolution.conflicts` entry
anywhere above means a name that exists can never legally resolve where
it's referenced (wrong project/owner_group, or a cycle) — that needs a
rename or a scope fix, not another upload.

YAML file format (a single template document, or `templates: [...]` for
several):

```yaml
templates:
  - template:
      name: "BTOF Stavelet"
      project: "ePIC"           # default "ePIC"

                                           # above if it's uploaded later.
```

See `data/btof_split/` for the full, real worked example: the ePIC
Barrel Time-of-Flight (BTOF) detector's Stave → Half-Stave → Stavelet
hierarchy, split one template per file (see `data/btof_split/README.md`),
with dimensions, sensor/ASIC counts, and timing/spatial resolution sourced
from public ePIC BTOF status talks. `data/btof_stave_templates.yaml` is
the original, now-**deprecated** monolithic version of the same three
templates -- kept only for its sourcing citations, not for loading; see
its header comment.

### Provenance and drift detection

Every successful `load_templates_from_yaml()` / `load-template` call
stamps three fields on each `DesignTemplate` it touches, automatically —
no separate step:

| Field | What it records |
|---|---|
| `source_path` | The YAML file's path, relative to the repo root when the file is inside a git checkout |
| `source_sha256` | SHA-256 of that file's exact content at the moment of this load |
| `source_git_commit` | `git rev-parse HEAD` of the repo at load time, best-effort (blank if the file isn't in a git checkout, or git isn't installed) |

These re-stamp on every load, including a no-op re-load of an
already-existing template, so they always describe the most recent load
attempt, not just whichever load happened to create the row. They answer
"exactly which file, and which version of it, produced this template" —
useful on their own, and the basis for the drift check below.

**Why a git *commit* hash isn't the primary mechanism here, even though
that's the obvious first idea**: git has no built-in way to keep a
commit hash *in* a file's own content that updates itself automatically —
the closest built-in features are the `ident` gitattribute (expands a
literal `$Id$` placeholder to the file's own **blob** hash, but only on
`git checkout`/`clone`, not on every edit or commit, so a file you've
just edited but not yet committed shows a stale value until the next
checkout) and `export-subst` (expands `$Format:%H$` to the commit hash,
but only inside `git archive` output, not in the working tree at all).
Neither actually gives an always-current, zero-extra-step answer sitting
in the file. Computing the hash freshly at load time, in Python, with no
dependency on git being installed or the file being tracked at all, does —
so that's what's implemented, with the git commit captured alongside it
as a best-effort bonus, not the primary signal.

**`verify-template FILE`** (`client.designs.verify_templates_from_yaml()`)
is the enforcement half: it re-parses a YAML file exactly like
`load-template` would, but never writes anything, and reports any
mismatch between what the file currently says and what's actually live —
catching drift regardless of how it happened (a Django admin edit, a
direct ORM/shell change, or simply a file that's been edited but not
re-loaded). `load-template` alone can't catch this, because
`get_or_create`'s `defaults=` only apply when a row is first created —
re-running it against an already-existing, since-edited row is a silent
no-op.

Illustrative output (not a captured run, unlike the other examples in this
file -- shown to demonstrate the report format):

```
$ python client/hdb.py verify-template data/btof_split/btof_stave.yaml
Template 'BTOF Stave': matches database

$ python client/hdb.py verify-template data/btof_split/btof_half_stave.yaml
Template 'BTOF Half-Stave': checked
    DRIFT: 'Stavelet Modules'.quantity: yaml=8 db=6

WARNING: database disagrees with this file -- see DRIFT lines above. Re-running
load-template will NOT fix an existing row's mismatched fields (only creates
what's missing); fix it by hand (Django shell) or accept the file as no longer
authoritative for that value.
```

Exits `1` if any real drift is found (safe to use in a script or CI step),
`0` otherwise. "File changed since last load" is reported too, but is
purely informational — it doesn't affect the exit code, since it just
means "run `load-template` again," not that anything is actually wrong.

**`subsystem-hash NAME`** (`client.designs.subsystem_fingerprint()` /
`DesignTemplate.subsystem_fingerprint()`) answers a different question:
not "does this one file match the database" but "is this whole subtree,
as a unit, the same as some other known state" — a single composite hash
over a named template and everything beneath it (via
`descendant_template_ids()`), derived from each one's own
`source_sha256`. It's a summary computed *from* the per-template vector,
not a replacement for it — `verify-template` is still what tells you
*which* piece disagrees; this is what lets you compare "the whole BTOF
subsystem" as one value instead of eyeballing three hashes.

Only meaningful once the whole subtree is **complete** (see
`DesignTemplate.is_complete()`) — a fingerprint of a subtree still
waiting on an un-uploaded sub-template would describe a provisional
state, not a real one, so both the model method and this command return
"not complete, no fingerprint" instead. Computed fresh on every call
(model-method and web page alike), never cached — if a descendant's
`source_sha256` changes, or the tree's structure changes, the very next
call already reflects it.

```
$ python client/hdb.py subsystem-hash "BTOF Stave"
'BTOF Stave': 7a2c9e...f01b  (64 hex chars)
  (3 template(s) in this subtree)
    BTOF Half-Stave: 4f8b1a...
    BTOF Stave: 7a2c9e...
    BTOF Stavelet: c910de...

$ python client/hdb.py subsystem-hash "BEMC tower"
'BEMC tower': 9d4e21...  (64 hex chars)
  (1 template(s) in this subtree)
    BEMC tower: (no recorded source)  [never loaded from a YAML file -- see missing_provenance]

Note: 1 of the above have no recorded source file (created via seed_hdb, admin,
or the shell rather than load-template) -- this fingerprint reflects their
current state, but it can't tell you whether that state matches any particular
version of a tracked YAML file.
```

(Illustrative — not a captured run.) The `BEMC tower` case above is worth
having in mind before using it as a test: it's a flat, single-node
template (two `component` placeholders, no `child_template` nesting), and
it predates the provenance system (created by `seed_hdb`, so its
`source_sha256` has always been empty). It's a fine smoke test that the
mechanism works end-to-end — complete → fingerprint, gated correctly —
but it won't exercise the multi-template composite case that motivated
this feature the way `BTOF Stave` (three templates, all loaded via
`load-template`, real `source_sha256` values) does.

Shown on the template detail page too, in the same field-group style as
Nesting Levels — but only when the template is complete; nothing is
shown otherwise, same as `pending_placeholders`.

`load-template FILE` resolves `FILE` against the current directory first,
then falls back to `<project root>/data/FILE` — so both a bare filename and
an explicit path work, run from anywhere. `--user` is optional here (unlike
`create-instance`) since this is a curator operation, not a per-request
write.

#### Deleting a template

A `DesignTemplate` can be deleted outright — in the web UI (the "Delete
Template" button on its detail page) or via `client.designs.delete_template()`
/ `hdb.py delete-template` — but only while it's **unlocked**, i.e. no
`Design` has ever been instantiated from it (`template.designs.exists()`
is `False`), **and** not nested as a sub-template inside another
template's placeholder (`template.parent_elements.exists()` is `False` --
`DesignTemplateElement.child_template` is `PROTECT`ed at the database
level for exactly this reason: deleting it out from under a live
`child_template` reference would leave that placeholder pointing at
nothing). This is the same immutability rule that freezes a template's
placeholders once it's been used (see the ["Domain 3 — Designs" section of
the top-level README](../README.md#domain-3--designs) for the full
reasoning): a template that already backs a real, instantiated design can't
be edited *or* deleted, so "instantiated from BEMC tower" always means the
same bill of placeholders.

Unlike editing (open to any member of the template's `owner_group`, or a
superuser), **deletion is superuser-only** — a deliberately stricter
policy, since removing the template removes it for every group member at
once rather than just changing the deleter's own records. `--user` is
required and must be a Django superuser; the web UI hides the button
entirely for non-superusers and 403s a direct POST.

```
$ python client/hdb.py --user crafts delete-template "BTOF Stavelet"
Error: User 'crafts' is not a superuser and cannot delete design templates.

$ python client/hdb.py --user maxim delete-template "BEMC tower"
Delete design template 'BEMC tower'? This cannot be undone. [y/N] y
Error: Design template 'BEMC tower' is locked -- 1 design(s) have been instantiated from it.

$ python client/hdb.py --user maxim delete-template "BTOF Stavelet" --yes
Deleted template 'BTOF Stavelet'.
```

`--yes` skips the interactive confirmation prompt (useful for scripting).
Deleting a template that's still referenced as another template's
`child_template` placeholder now fails with a clear error instead:

```
$ python client/hdb.py --user maxim delete-template "BTOF Stavelet" --yes
Error: Design template 'BTOF Stavelet' is nested as a sub-template inside: BTOF Half-Stave. Remove that placeholder (or the referencing template) first.
```

Delete the referencing template instead, or -- if only that one placeholder
needs to go -- remove it directly. There's no web UI or CLI command for
removing a single placeholder (the old per-row "Save"/"×" controls on the
template detail page were removed — they wrote straight to the database and
could silently fork from the YAML file, see the Design Templates section
above); do it from the Django shell instead:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=client python manage.py shell
```
```python
from hdb.models import DesignTemplateElement
DesignTemplateElement.objects.get(
    template__name="BTOF Half-Stave", element_name="Stavelet Modules"
).delete()
```

```python
client.designs.delete_template(name="BTOF Stavelet")
# -> {"template": "BTOF Stavelet", "deleted": True}
# Raises PermissionError if self.user isn't a superuser, or RuntimeError
# if the template is locked.
```

### Access control — `hdb_client/access.py`

- **Read**: unrestricted for any authenticated (or unauthenticated/`user=None`)
  client — HDB is a shared collaboration database with no per-row read
  privacy. `visible_to()` is a hook for tightening this later; currently a
  no-op.
- **Write**: a user may create/modify/delete a row if they're its
  `owner_user`, they're Django staff/superuser, or they're a member of
  `owner_group` *and* `group_writeable` is `True`. A user creating a new row
  may only ever set `owner_user` to themselves and `owner_group` to a group
  they belong to — never to someone/something else.

---

## 2. Command-line interface — `hdb.py`

```bash
python client/hdb.py [--settings MODULE] [--root DIR] [--user USERNAME] [--yaml] COMMAND [args...]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--settings` | Django settings module (default `hdb_project.settings`) |
| `--root` | Project root directory (default: parent of `client/`) |
| `--user` | Django username to act as. Only needed for `create-instance` — every other command works fine unauthenticated. |
| `--yaml` | Force YAML output for commands that default to a plain table |

Set up a `bin/hdb` wrapper (not included in the repo) if you want to just
type `hdb ...`:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
printf '#!/usr/bin/env bash\nexec python3 "$(dirname "$0")/../client/hdb.py" "$@"\n' > bin/hdb
chmod +x bin/hdb
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

### `institutions`

```
$ python client/hdb.py institutions

### `location-tree <ABBR>`

```
$ python client/hdb.py location-tree CUA

### `systems`

```
$ python client/hdb.py systems

```

### `search <QUERY...>`

Cross-domain keyword search over components, inventory instances, and
designs (not institutions or technical systems — use `find`/`institutions`/
`systems` for those).

```
$ python client/hdb.py search Crystal

-- components --
  id: cdc27f3f-...  |  name: PbWO4 Crystal  |  model_number: PWO-BEMC-01  |  ...

-- instances --
  id: e7a1c023-...  |  tag: BEMC-CRYSTAL-003  |  serial_number: PWO-0003  |  ...
  ...

-- designs --
  id: c0db7fa1-...  |  name: BEMC tower  |  description: One BEMC tower...  |  ...
```

### `component <NAME...>` — full Component summary, YAML

```
$ python client/hdb.py component "PbWO4 Crystal"
id: cdc27f3f-ba78-4561-b7d2-8ef56b5e5026
name: PbWO4 Crystal
model_number: PWO-BEMC-01
description: Lead tungstate scintillating crystal for the Backward EMCal.
technical_system: BEMC-CRYSTAL
owner_user: crafts
owner_group: BEMC
instance_count: 3
properties:
- property_type: Weight
  value: '0.45'
  units: kg
...
```

### `inventory <PK>` — full instance detail, YAML

```
$ python client/hdb.py inventory e80ed9a1-3ac7-4afa-b540-19c575d89fe7
tag: BEMC-CRYSTAL-001
serial_number: PWO-0001
component: PbWO4 Crystal
location: CUA / Storage Room
owner_user: crafts
owner_group: BEMC
...
```

### `where <PK>` — quick "where is this thing right now"

```
$ python client/hdb.py where e80ed9a1-3ac7-4afa-b540-19c575d89fe7
ID       : e80ed9a1-3ac7-4afa-b540-19c575d89fe7
Component: PbWO4 Crystal
System   : BEMC-CRYSTAL
Location : CUA / Storage Room
Site     : CUA  (Washington, DC, USA)
Owner    : crafts
Group    : BEMC
```

### `bom <DESIGN_NAME...>` — recursive Bill of Materials

```
$ python client/hdb.py bom "BEMC tower"
[COMPONENT] Crystal  x1  -> PbWO4 Crystal
[COMPONENT] SiPM  x4  -> Hamamatsu S14160-3010PS
```

Use `--yaml` for the full nested tree (including `installed_ids`).

### `find <TYPE> <PATTERN>` — glob-match by name/tag

`TYPE` is one of `component`, `instance`, `design`, `system`. `PATTERN` is a
case-insensitive glob (`fnmatch`), e.g. `"PbWO4*"`, `"*sensor*"`.

```
$ python client/hdb.py find component "PbWO4*"
ID                                    Name           Model No.    System        Owner   Group

...
```

### `create-instance` — write a new inventory item

**Requires `--user`** (global flag, comes before the subcommand). The created
record is always owned by that user — there is no flag to assign it to
someone else (see Access control, above).

```bash
# Individual flags
python client/hdb.py --user crafts create-instance \
    --by-name "PbWO4 Crystal" --tag BEMC-CRYSTAL-099 --serial PWO-0099 \
    --group BEMC --description "New delivery, batch 12"

# Identify the component by UUID instead of name
python client/hdb.py --user crafts create-instance \
    --by-pk cdc27f3f-ba78-4561-b7d2-8ef56b5e5026 --tag BEMC-CRYSTAL-100

# From a YAML file
python client/hdb.py --user crafts create-instance --from-yaml instance.yaml
python client/hdb.py --user crafts create-instance --from-yaml -   # stdin
```

`instance.yaml`:
```yaml
by_name: "PbWO4 Crystal"        # or: by_pk: <uuid>
tag: BEMC-CRYSTAL-099
serial: "PWO-0099"
location: "Storage Room"
group: BEMC
description: "New delivery, batch 12"
```

Real output:
```
$ python client/hdb.py --user crafts create-instance --by-name "PbWO4 Crystal" --tag BEMC-CRYSTAL-099 --group BEMC
Created: 22f0b691-61db-4d35-876b-eb88113670bf
id: 22f0b691-61db-4d35-876b-eb88113670bf
tag: BEMC-CRYSTAL-099
owner_user: crafts
owner_group: BEMC
...
```

`--group` must be a group `--user` actually belongs to (or `--user` must be
staff/superuser) — otherwise:
```
Error creating instance: User 'crafts' is not a member of group 'BTOF' and cannot create records owned by it.
```
And omitting `--user` entirely fails with:
```
Error creating instance: Authentication required to create inventory records.
```

## 3. MCP server — `mcp_server.py`

Exposes the same `hdb_client` layer over MCP (Streamable HTTP transport
only — no stdio), so an MCP-aware AI assistant can query HDB.

**Read-only by policy.** This server exposes query tools only — no
create/update/delete tool is registered here, regardless of what
`hdb_client` itself supports. A dialogue-driven agent connected over MCP
cannot add, edit, or delete anything in HDB; every write path (the CLI's
`create-instance`, the web app) still exists, just never wired up to a
tool here. `smoke_test.py` asserts no such tool is present, as a guard
against one being reintroduced by accident.

### Authentication

HTTP Basic Auth, checked against Django's own `auth.User` table (whatever
accounts already exist — `/admin/`, `createsuperuser`, etc.). There's no
separate credential store, and passwords are never logged or stored by this
file. Every authenticated request is bound to that Django user for its
duration, and every tool builds a `HDBClient(user=...)` scoped to them —
kept mainly for who's-asking traceability now that every tool is read-only,
and so a future tightening of read visibility in `hdb_client/access.py`
would apply here automatically. A basic in-memory lockout (5 failed
attempts per `client_ip:username` within 60s → 30s lockout) adds
brute-force friction; it's per-process and resets on restart, not a
substitute for a real solution in a multi-worker deployment.

### Setup

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra client

# from the project root, next to manage.py:
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=hdb_project.settings \
HDB_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/epic-hdb \
HDB_MCP_PUBLIC_HOST=your-tunnel-hostname.trycloudflare.com \
uv run --locked --extra client python client/mcp_server.py
```

Runs on `0.0.0.0:8001` (edit the bottom of `mcp_server.py` to change).

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | Which settings module to load (defaults to `hdb_project.settings` if unset) |
| `HDB_PROJECT_ROOT` | Project root to put on `sys.path` (defaults to the parent of `client/`) |
| `HDB_MCP_PUBLIC_HOST` | Your current public tunnel hostname (no scheme), e.g. from `cloudflared`. Required to let the MCP SDK's DNS-rebinding protection accept requests arriving through the tunnel — without it, tunneled requests get rejected with "Invalid Host header" before your auth check even runs. Re-set this every time the tunnel hostname changes. |

**Library version note**: the exact `mcp` SDK API this file uses
(`mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP`, `mcp.server.transport_security`,
`streamable_http_app()`) has moved around across releases. This repo was last
verified against `mcp[cli]==1.12.4`; the brand-new `mcp==2.0.0` is a breaking
rewrite with a different module layout and will not work as-is. If something
doesn't import, check `python -c "from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP;
print(dir(FastMCP))"` against your installed version.

### Available tools

| Tool | Equivalent to |
|---|---|
| `hdb_whoami` | Authenticated user's username, email, groups |
| `hdb_search(query, limit=15)` | `client.search_all()` |
| `hdb_where_is(instance_id)` | `client.where_is()` |
| `hdb_component_search(query, limit=25)` | `client.catalog.search_brief()` |
| `hdb_component_summary(component_name)` | `client.catalog.summary()` |
| `hdb_instance_search(query, limit=25)` | `client.inventory.search_brief()` |
| `hdb_instance_detail(instance_id)` | `client.inventory.detail()` |
| `hdb_instances_at_institution(institution_abbreviation, limit=25)` | `client.inventory.at_institution()` |
| `hdb_design_search(query, limit=25)` | `client.designs.search_brief()` |
| `hdb_design_summary(design_name)` | `client.designs.summary()` |
| `hdb_design_bom(design_name)` | `client.designs.bom()` |
| `hdb_list_institutions()` | `client.locations.all_institutions()` |
| `hdb_location_tree(institution_abbreviation)` | `client.locations.location_tree()` |
| `hdb_systems_overview()` | `client.systems.instance_counts()` |

No write tool (create/update/delete) is registered — see "Read-only by
policy" above.

### Talking to it from an MCP client

Point any MCP client at `http://<host>:8001/mcp/` with HTTP Basic Auth using
Django credentials. Example using the official Python SDK directly:

```python
import anyio, httpx
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.streamable_http import streamablehttp_client

async def main():
    creds = httpx.BasicAuth("crafts", "crafts")
    async with streamablehttp_client("http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp/", auth=creds) as (read, write, _):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.call_tool("hdb_search", {"query": "Crystal"})
            print(result.content[0].text)

anyio.run(main)
```

### Testing it — `smoke_test.py`

End-to-end check covering both the auth boundary (raw HTTP, no MCP protocol)
and every tool (authenticated as the seed user `crafts`), plus a check that
no write tool has been registered. Since nothing it calls mutates the
database, running it repeatedly no longer leaves behind test data.

```bash
# Terminal 1
uv run --locked --extra client python manage.py seed_hdb          # idempotent, safe to re-run
HDB_PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd) uv run --locked --extra client python client/mcp_server.py

# Terminal 2
uv sync --locked --extra client
uv run --locked --extra client python client/smoke_test.py
uv run --locked --extra client python client/smoke_test.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8001 --username gnigmat --password gnigmat
```

Last verified run (before the write tool was removed): **24/24 checks
passed**. The suite hasn't been re-run against a live server since --
worth doing once before relying on it, to confirm the updated tool-listing
and no-write-tool checks pass against a running instance.

---

## Notes

- All three layers are read-unrestricted, write-restricted-by-ownership — see
  *Access control* above. There is currently no way, in any of the three
  layers, for a caller to assign a new record's ownership to anyone other
  than themselves.
- The client layer's own serializers (`hdb_client/serializers.py`) are
  plain functions, independent of the web app's DRF-based `/api/` endpoints.
